## Micaels-Portfolio
Micael Samuel's deployed portfolio of work samples.

## Description
My project will be able to show hiring managers a portfolio of my work, know about me, how to contact me as well as how I look. There are clickable links to my projects.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
